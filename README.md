# Intelly Server

Intelly is a platform being built to help small-to-medium food and beverage brands manage various aspects of their business. The project is divided into separate repos as services are developed on different timelines. Currently the retail data dashboard (link below) and the Node.js/Express server (this repo) are the two with public demos.

This project has been built with Node.js, Express, MySQL, Bcrypt, and JWT.

The data from this server can be accessed through the retail data dashboard demo (https://happy-saha-7828d3.netlify.app/), and is updated with each significant addition to the private version. You can log in with the following credentials:

email: admin@intelly.test / password: admin

The public repo for the data dashboard can be ofund here: https://github.com/tomekregulski/intelly

The private version of this project is currently in its first trial stage with clients. Upon its completion, a second trial with a larger group of clients is planned, after which it will be officially launched.
